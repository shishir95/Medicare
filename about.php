                                <p>The aim of “MEDICARE” is take appointment of any special doctor from anywhere in Bangladesh.
                                  This project specially for those people who live in rural areas and have little access of health care service.
                                  In hour country 70% people lives in rural areas and get little health care service in compared to urban people.
                                  In addition, rural people need to travel from village to city area for make appointment.
                                  More importantly sometimes a patient need to make an appointment over phone call which is not efficient
                                  way because sometimes patient faces s many hassles whenever he/she takes appointment from the assistant of a particular doctor.</p>

                                <p>Bangladesh is populated country and the health sector is not good.
                                  Specially in rural area. There are littles access of health care facilities.
                                  Every year thousands of people die without getting proper treatment.
                                  So it the challenge for us to improve the health care facilities in rural areas in Bangladesh.
                                 I this case we want to add more feature in including online consultation service.
                                 In this situation anyone get proper treatment from experienced doctor from distance.
                                 We want also develop android and IOS app for mobile user and make it user friendly system. </p>
